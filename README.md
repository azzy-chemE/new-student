# New Student

## Instructions

Left and right arrow keys to navigate, up arrow to jump. Double jumping is enabled, just press the up arrow key twice quickly. 

## Note

If you fall, there are no checkpoints. Refresh/restart the game and continue from the beginning. It is designed to be frustrating!

## AI disclosure

I followed the tutorial for building a platformer for Jumpstart here, but some of the instructions didn't line up since the tutorial uses Godot 4, and I was on Godot 3 for Windows 7. I asked ChatGPT how to rewrite the code in the tutorial to be suitable for Godot 3, and on how to debug, because I'm not familiar with GDScript. While AI helped, I sure did learn a lot, and I left comments in so that I can refer back to it and understand.

## Game description

New Student is a simple platformer starring a harpy eagle as the player character. You navigate a series of precarious glass tiles from a laboratory that are suspended in the air. You can choose to take an easy path, or challenge yourself and potentially fall. Eventually, the tiles will spell out messages that guide you forward... or do they?

Every jump, slip, and careful landing mirrors the trials of learning and perseverance (if you're bad at games) or the easiness of something once you've gotten over the challenges (if you're good at games.) 

This is my first game created using real code, moving beyond Scratch and exploring the true mechanics of game development. Inspired by my own pursuit of mastery in STEM (chemical engineering and computer science in particular), this simple creation made for Hack Club's Daydream Jumpstart event is about the mindset required to keep learning, experimenting, and pushing forward despite setbacks.

Some of the bottom tiles are purposefully hidden from the screen. You should trust yourself to know when it is safe to fall and when it is not. This is part intuition-based and partially based on the visual context provided to you. The hardest part of the game is knowing when you can fall, and when to double-jump. You might overestimate and underestimate yourself.

## Assets

Tile design and player were drawn by me in Kleki Paint Tool.
